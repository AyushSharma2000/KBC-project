Assignment Name The KBC Game.

The KBC game has been made to come off as very simple to play, precise and in a minimalist style thus containing only the elements required for successfully playing the game without any unnecessary complications.                                         
We have debugged the code intensively considering a large number of borderline cases and it isn't expected that any bug should creep in during the gameplay.                                                                                         
The controls in the game are simple and consist of digits and alphabets. It is suggested to stick to the controls which shall be mentioned at each step of the gameplay to have a realistic experience of the popular gameshow "Kaun Banega Crorepati".               
Hope you have fun playing the KBC game.                                                                                           
P.S.:-I understand that it is an official graded assignment but we would be very grateful to receive suggestions on how we could have written a better code.Thank You.
